## 💼 DevOps / Site Reliability / SysOps Engineer

Versatile engineer with solid experience in DevOps, SRE, and SysOps. Skilled in infrastructure automation, monitoring, incident management, and system administration. I bring order to chaos, reduce alert fatigue, document processes, and keep systems running smoothly — from servers and clusters to CI/CD pipelines. Born in Kulunda, so I can chop wood and deploy production with equal confidence.
